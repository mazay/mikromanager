# MikroTik API pollers, defaults to `1` if ommited
# it is recommended to have at lest 2 pollers in order to mitigate possible network issues,
# i.e. if a devices times out this will slow down polling for other resources as they will be waiting in the queue

# devicePollerInterval defines how often devices should be polled,
# the time is between finish of a previous run and start of the new one
# defaults to 300 seconds if ommited
# valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h"
